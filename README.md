# project-template
Template for Jupyter Notebook based research projects. Update description on a project by project basis to describe additional folder hierarchy.

- `data` | Store data here. Provide instructions to download sensitive data if necessary.

- `figures` | Store figures naming folders according to notebook name.

- `notebooks` | Each notebook should represent a coherent chunk of the analysis.

- `publish` | Save all final project exports for publishing and sharing.

- `scripts` | This folder should incude function libraries, data munging scripts, or other code that would otherwise clutter the notebook. All high-levels commands necessary to follow the analyses should be kept here.

- `Start_Notebook.ipynb` | Use this notebook as the landing page for the project. Link out all additional notebook from here.
