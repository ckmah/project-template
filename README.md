# project-template
Template for Jupyter Notebook based research projects.

- `data` | Store relevant data here. Self-explanatory

- `deliver` | Clean notebooks are stored here. Notebooks are presentable and should not contain any prototyping or debugging code. Code should be clean and organized. Each notebook should represent a coherent chunk of the analysis. Notebooks should be labeled sequentially:
  > 1 - Name<br>
  > 2 - Name<br>
  > 3 - Name

- `develop` | Developmental notebooks that may be messy, but provide a narrative of the all data exploration. Notebook names should follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD-cm-some-description`.

- `figures` | Store figures naming folders according to notebook name.

- `scripts` | Any repetitive cross-notebook code should be stored here in scripts. Tasks that don't need to be rerun or notebooks that have irrelevant outputs should be converted to a script.
