# deliver folder

Clean notebooks are stored here. Notebooks are presentable and should not contain any prototyping or debugging code. Code should be clean and organized. Each notebook should represent a coherent chunk of the analysis.


Follow notebook organization conventions as stated in the develop [README.md](../develop/README.md).

Notebooks should be labeled sequentially:

> 1 - Notebook1

> 2 - Notebook2

> 3 - Notebook3
